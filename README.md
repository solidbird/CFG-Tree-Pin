# CFG Tree Pin

I am currently trying to build a CFG Tree with Pin just to get familiar with programming again and learning
about the Pin Instrumentation Tool. 

Usage (Make sure to change the path of your pin framework in the "pintool.sh" file):
```
sudo ./pintool.sh <filename of pin tool without extension> && pin -t <filename of pin tool>.so -- <binary to run>
```
