# CFG Tree Pin

This tool is walking through an CFG Tree Path with Pin Instrumentation Tool. Maybe I will use this part as a feature in another software project.

Usage (Make sure to change the path of your pin framework in the "pintool.sh" file):
```
sudo ./pintool.sh <filename of pin tool without extension> && pin -t <filename of pin tool>.so -- <binary to run>
```
